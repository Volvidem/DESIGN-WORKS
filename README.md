# DESIGN-WORKS
This repository contains various designing works I have done over the interval of 2 years. They have been done on Photoshop and InDesign.
The works that are present were done mostly as a part of the designing work done for the various events taking place in my college and some of the projects were done in my leisure time. In the works i do, i try to bring out the best in them by playing around with colour combinations, image combinations and incorporting as much of art i see in everyday life as possible and what i derive from it.
Afterall being able to express what i see or feel in my work is what motivates me to create something new and better.
